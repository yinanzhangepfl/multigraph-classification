# Learning to Represent Whole Slide Images by Selecting Cell Graphs of Patches
Yinan Zhang, Beril Besbinar, Pascal Frossard

## Overview
This code is developed for the paper "Learning to Represent Whole Slide Images by Selecting Cell Graphs of Patches". In this paper, we propose an algorithm for classifying multi-graphs with automatic graph selection. Our framework introduces stochastic layers with discrete random variables into traditional graph neural networks and is end-to-end differentiable.
